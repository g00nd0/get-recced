### Description

The Music Search and Recommender App let's you search for your favourite artists and get detailed information on their work, as well as recommendations for similar sounding artists!

Select "Start Searching" from the dropdown menu, then type the artist you want to look up in the search field and hit "Search".

A list of artists that closely match you search will appear. Then select the artist you want to specifically view.

The artist's page will show their entire discography. You can choose to view either the artist's discography, or similar artists based on your search by hitting either the "SHOW DISCOGRAPHY" or "SHOW SIMILAR ARTISTS" buttons below the band's genre.

On the "SHOW SIMILAR ARTISTS" page, recommended bands are shown with a description of the band and links to their Music on YouTube, as well as their Wikipedia page.
